## Key Features

### 1. Smart Contact Processing
```typescript
// Automatic phone number cleaning and validation
const cleanPhoneNumber = (phone: string) => {
  const cleaned = phone.replace(/\D/g, '');
  if (cleaned.length === 10) return `+1${cleaned}`;
  if (cleaned.length === 11 && cleaned.startsWith('1')) return `+${cleaned}`;
  return null; // Invalid format
};
```

### 2. Concurrent Call Management
```python
# Manage concurrent calls with semaphore
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(settings.max_concurrent_calls)

async def make_campaign_call(campaign_id, contact, semaphore):
    async with semaphore:
        # Execute individual call
        await initiate_vapi_call(campaign, contact)
```

### 3. Compliance & Scheduling
```python
def is_calling_hours_compliant(settings):
    current_time = datetime.now().time()
    start_time = datetime.strptime(settings["calling_hours_start"], "%H:%M").time()
    end_time = datetime.strptime(settings["calling_hours_end"], "%H:%M").time()
    
    if settings["exclude_weekends"] and datetime.now().weekday() >= 5:
        return False
    
    return start_time <= current_time <= end_time
```

### 4. Real-Time Progress Tracking
```typescript
// Live progress updates with visual indicators
const progressPercentage = (stats.calls_attempted / stats.total_contacts) * 100;

<div className="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2">
  <div
    className="bg-blue-600 h-2 rounded-full"
    style={{ width: `${progressPercentage}%` }}
  />
</div>
```
